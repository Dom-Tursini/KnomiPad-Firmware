# First‑Time Setup & Wi‑Fi

KnomiPad uses Wi‑Fi for its **web editor** and Bluetooth for the **HID keyboard**.

---

## 1) Power up
Connect the Knomi V2 via USB‑C. After flashing, it boots to the **Home clock**.

## 2) Connect to the KnomiPad Access Point
On first boot (or after a factory reset), the device creates:
- **SSID**: `KnomiPad`  (no password)

Join it, then visit **`http://knomipad.local`**. You’ll see the Wi‑Fi setup page.

## 3) Pick your Wi‑Fi
Scan for networks, select your home Wi‑Fi, and enter the password.  
Click **Connect** → the device reboots and joins your network.

> If you mistype the password, a **Wi‑Fi error** prompt appears on the device at next boot. You can retry or clear credentials.

## 4) Use the Web Editor
Browse to **`http://knomipad.local`** on your network.  
Create macros, upload icons (PNG), choose colors (linear gradient top→bottom), and **Save**.

- **Export / Import** for backups/sharing.  
- **Sync Time & Date** to sync the Home clock with your computer.  
- **Firmware Reset** clears macros, icons **and Wi‑Fi**, then reboots.

## 5) Pair over Bluetooth
- Pair **KnomiPad** in your OS Bluetooth settings.  
- Open a text field and tap a macro to test.

> Still not typing? Forget/remove the device, reboot KnomiPad, and pair again. See **Troubleshooting**.
